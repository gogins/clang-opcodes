abstract="This chapter describes the combination of two high-level audio and music programming systems, Faust and Csound. The latter is a MUSIC N-derived language, with a large set of unit generators and a long history of development. The former is a purely functional language designed to describe audio processing algorithms that can be compiled into a variety of formats. The two systems are combined in the Faust Csound opcodes, which allow the on-the-fly programming, compilation and instantiation of Faust DSP programs in a running Csound environment. Examples are presented, and the concept of Ubiquitous Music Ecosystem is discussed.",
